# LacunaDocs

This is the (possible) next version of the Lacuna documentation site. In the current state, pages taken from the current version have been edited minimally so that there are no formatting errors, and everything else is left untouched. Most places use the standard Docusaurus configuration.

_Work in progress._

## Run it locally

The steps are quite simple:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install npm dependencies in the cloned folder
3. Run `npm run start` and wait for the browser window to open.
   Should you make any changes while the process is running, the documentation will be rebuilt and the page will reload automatically.
