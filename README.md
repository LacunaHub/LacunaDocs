# LacunaDocs

This is the (possible) next version of the Lacuna documentation site. Work in progress.

## Run it locally

The steps are quite simple:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install npm dependencies in the cloned folder
3. Run `npm run start` and wait for the browser window to open.
   Should you make any changes while the process is running, the documentation will be rebuilt and the page will reload automatically.
